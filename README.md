boxotop is an iPhone-only app running on iOS 10 and later.

It features a search field to lookup movies by their titles using the omdbapi.com/ API.

From the search results list, selecting a movie will load further details and display them on a separate screen. From there, users can select and save their own rating of the movie.

Movies whose details are displayed will be automatically saved in the history and accessible offline.

The project's dependencies are managed with Carthage. Therefore please run `carthage bootstrap --platform ios` before building the project.
